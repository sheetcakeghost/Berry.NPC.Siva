    //Siva's Chef Dialogue
        "Siva.Chef.01": "I am preparing Mr. Qi a signature culinary creation with prismatic shard embellishment today.$7 He merely observes the chromatic display rather than consuming it—he lacks the capacity to appreciate its flavor nuances.$3 A most unfortunate waste of premium ingredients.$6",
    
        "Siva.Chef.02": "I have been experimenting with various gemstone incorporations in my gastronomic compositions.$0 Amethyst yields a delicate sweetness when illuminated correctly, while topaz presents a more vibrant flavor profile.$4 Mr. Qi pretends comprehension, but his appreciation is entirely performative.$3",

        "Siva.Spring.17": "The desert reminds me of the great voids of space, where nothingness reigns. Yet here, life has found a way to survive. It's a fascinating contradiction, isn't it? $1",
        
        "Siva.Spring.18": "In the desert, the earth does not yield easily. It's as though the soil is holding onto its secrets, hiding them beneath layers of sand. A stark contrast to the easy embrace of life found elsewhere. $1",

        "Siva.Spring.20": "When I look up at the stars, I think of the millions of other worlds that exist out there, some teeming with life, others completely barren. Yet, here in this place, in the quiet of winter, I feel as though I've found something rare, something real. $1",
        
        "Siva.Spring.21": "The desert does not experience fall the way other places do, but there is a subtle change in the air. The winds grow cooler, as if the planet itself is taking a breath before winter arrives. $1",
        
        "Siva.Spring.22": "Space is cold. The void between stars is inhospitable, silent, and lifeless. But here in your world, the chill of winter somehow feels welcoming, like the planet is offering its own kind of warmth. $1",
        
        "Siva.Spring.23": "I come from a place where the sky is not blue, but a deep, endless black, dotted with the faintest glimmers of distant suns. Yet here, the air is full of life, and I find comfort in its simple rhythm. $1",
        
        "Siva.Spring.24": "In space, there are no seasons. No changes in the atmosphere. Here, in your world, these subtle shifts remind me of how delicate and precious life can be. A beautiful contrast to the harshness of space. $1",
        
        "Siva.Spring.25": "You know, there is something quite beautiful about the way your world turns. It may be a slow dance, but it is a dance nonetheless.",

        "Siva.Winter.15": "When I look up at the stars, I think of the millions of other worlds that exist out there, some teeming with life, others completely barren. Yet, here in this place, in the quiet of winter, I feel as though I've found something rare, something real. $1",
        
        "Siva.Winter.16": "The desert does not experience fall the way other places do, but there is a subtle change in the air. The winds grow cooler, as if the planet itself is taking a breath before winter arrives. $1",
        
        "Siva.Winter.17": "Space is cold. The void between stars is inhospitable, silent, and lifeless. But here in your world, the chill of winter somehow feels welcoming, like the planet is offering its own kind of warmth. $1",
        
        "Siva.Winter.18": "I come from a place where the sky is not blue, but a deep, endless black, dotted with the faintest glimmers of distant suns. Yet here, the air is full of life, and I find comfort in its simple rhythm. $1",

        "Siva.Weather.Winter.01": "Snow: solidified hydrogen dioxide configurations descending from atmospheric heights.$0 My homeland featured silicon-compound precipitation that constructed elaborate vitreous arboreal formations. Considerably less accommodating for pedestrian activity.$3",
    
        "Siva.Weather.Winter.04": "I have documented human tendencies toward increased domiciliary confinement during the hibernal period.

Siva's Heart Events: The Light Gourmet
    
Event Summary List

0-Heart Event: The Medical Emergency
    Location: Clinic or Desert
    Scene: Farmer offers to call a doctor when Siva is injured or ill
    Plot: Siva admits he can't see a human doctor because his physiology is different
    Dialogue: "Please don't call anyone. I... I know this must come as a great shock, but my internal organs aren't arranged like yours."
    Dialogue Options for Farmer:
        "It was pretty obvious, actually. You've been drinking saltwater like it's soda and your skin is blue."
            "So you can see my true form then. Concerning, but I have noticed some of the children commenting on my appearance. Perhaps my cloaking technology isn't as universal as I'd presumed..."
        "An ALIEN? That's... that's impossible!"
            "Oh, so forest spirits and talking animals you accept, but you draw the line at extra terrestrial visitors?"
        "Are you dangerous? Should I be worried?"
            "Yes, I'm one of many from a alien attack force that was meant to scout this place and ... okay, stop hyperventilating, this is a joke. I'm not dangerous. I'm just... different."
    Resolution: Farmer helps Siva find a solution, deepening trust as Siva shows vulnerability about his non-human limitations

2-Heart Event: Salt & Light
    Location: Beach or Saloon
    Scene: Player discovers Siva examining salt with great curiosity
    Plot: Siva is fascinated by humans' casual consumption of minerals, studying salt specifically
    Dialogue: "You humans consume sodium chloride daily without ceremony, yet it's quite remarkable—it captures and preserves the memory of ancient seas and sunlight. A rather... pedestrian flavor profile, but impressively efficient for your species."
    Resolution: Siva shares insights about how different preparation methods affect salt's "light retention," treating it like humans would discuss wine aging

4-Heart Event Option 4: Adaptation Challenges
    Location: Clinic or Desert
    Scene: Siva struggling with an Earth-specific environmental challenge
    Plot: He's developed a reaction to something common on Earth (pollen, water composition, etc.)
    Dialogue: While dealing with this challenge, Siva reveals more about his physical nature and adaptation strategies
    Resolution: The player helps him find a solution, deepening trust as Siva shows vulnerability about his non-human limitations

6-Heart Event: Qi's Menu
    Location: Casino kitchen
    Scene: Siva preparing specialized "dishes" from minerals while talking about Qi
    Plot: Through his cooking process, Siva reveals more about his complicated relationship with Qi
    Dialogue: "Qi provides these basic ingredients, but they're hardly the quality I'm accustomed to. Like offering a chef nothing but potatoes and expecting gourmet cuisine. Still... one adapts. The universal skill of the displaced."
    Resolution: Despite his complaints, Siva creates something beautiful, showing his resilience and creativity even with limited resources

8-Heart Event Option 3: Blik's Mischief
    Location: Town or forest
    Scene: Blik has gotten into trouble with the local wildlife/townspeople
    Plot: Siva and the player must track down Blik and fix whatever chaos he's caused
    Dialogue: While solving the problem, Siva reveals more about his and Blik's relationship - how they found each other, their journeys together, and their unusual bond
    Resolution: Once Blik is safely retrieved, Siva shows a vulnerable moment of attachment, admitting that despite Blik's troublesome nature, he's the closest thing to family Siva has in this corner of the universe

10-Heart Event: Blik's Special Diet
    Location: Desert at night
    Scene: Blik appears unwell, refusing regular "food"
    Plot: Siva explains that Blik needs a specific combination of minerals and light that's rare on Earth
    Dialogue: "Blik's palate is even more specialized than mine. He requires light that's been filtered through selenium crystals under specific stellar alignments. On our world, it's common. Here... well, I've been improvising."
    Resolution: Player helps find a rare mineral that, when processed by Siva, creates exactly what Blik needs, strengthening the bond between all three

14-Heart Event: The Memory Feast
    Location: A special location meaningful to your friendship
    Scene: Siva has prepared his masterpiece—a dish capturing the specific light of significant moments
    Plot: Using locations you've visited together, Siva has collected and preserved the unique light signatures
    Dialogue: "In my culture, we preserve important relationships by capturing and consuming the light of shared moments. This crystal contains the sunset from the beach when we first really talked. This one, the moonlight from the night we helped Blik. Together, they tell our story."
    Resolution: Siva shares that this is the most meaningful "meal" he's prepared on Earth—one that contains genuine connection rather than just sustenance
